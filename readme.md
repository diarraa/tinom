**tinom** is a Java library that aims at managing monitoring configurations of various tools.  
Said differently, it tries to abstract and provide a unique entry-point to configure monitoring tools.
This approach is based on the principles of OCCI Monitoring. OCCI by itself is a set of specifications
with a focus to standardize cloud APIs management. OCCI Monitoring is the declination of OCCI for Software supervision.

Even if originally, OCCI is about cloud computing, the fact is OCCI Monitoring perfectly fit casual issues related to
monitoring, be it in the cloud or with usual infrastructures.

**tinom** is the anagram of **monit** and stands for *This Is Not OCCI Monitoring*.
